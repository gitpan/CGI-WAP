Module: CGI::WAP

Description:
    CGI::WAP provides WML output and WAP methods for CGI programming, the
    purpose of the module is to retain the familiar CGI.pm way of
    programming to enable experienced CGI programmers to use their
    existing skills when creating WAP applications.

Prerequisites:
    perl 5.002, CGI.pm and XML::Parser

Build/Installation:
    Standard build/installation supported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3)...
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
    I don't know how to install Perl modules on Windows platforms, if
    someone could provide directions so I can include them here I would
    be grateful.

Planned Enhancements:
    Add support for /all/ attributes defined in the WML DTD, I think
    I've covered the most important ones already, but it's nice to 
    be complete.
    Addition to CPAN, but I don't know if this really would fit below
    LDS' CGI:: hierarchy.
